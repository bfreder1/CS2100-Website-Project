            <h1>The Spear of Athens</h1>
            <p>
                The Spear of Athens is a legendary weapon from early rise of Athens' power. It channels the flames of
                war with the precision of a master tactician.
                Historical records indicate Athena herself gifted the spear to her adopted son, Erichthonius, as a show
                of her favor. As king, Erichthonius built
                Athens into a powerful city-state, and served as one of many symbols of Athena's protection over the
                city. Many kings and generals have wielded the
                Spear of Athens in battle, and its power has been felt across the Grecian Realms. After the collapse of
                the monarchy and the clergy of Athena, the
                spear was lost to history. While democracy reigned in Athens, the Aegis became the new great symbol of
                Athena's protection. The Spear of Athens
                remains a powerful artifact, and rumors suggest that it has resurfaced in the hands of a new hero.

                    Historians recently discovered that the spear was forged by Hephaestus himself, then blessed by
                    Athena with the power to channel the flames of war.
                    Athena forced Hephaestus to forge this spear as recompense for his attempted assault on her. This
                    assault resulted in the birth of Erichthonius,
                    whom Athena adopted as her own. Exactly when the spear was forged and when it was gifted to
                    Erichthonius is unknown, but it is believed to have
                    been sometime before Erichthonius' deposition of King Amphictyon. With the spear in hand,
                    Erichthonius both deposed Amphictyon and consolidated
                    power in Athens.

                    The last known wielder of the Spear of Athens was Pandion II, who ruled Athens before the
                    construction of the Trojan Walls. The spear was lost
                    after he fell into a deep madness and fled the city. Scholars believe that the weakening clergy and
                    ongoing secularization of Athens angered
                    Athena who cursed the sitting king. Pandion's flight from the city caused a schism in the city's
                    leadership during which the spear was lost.
                    The new democracy that emerged from the chaos decided that peace and protection were more valuable
                    tenets than war and conquest. The Aegis
                    then became the new symbol of Athena's favor and little effort was made to recover the Spear of
                    Athens.

                <h3>First Rediscovery</h3>
                <p>
                    Scholars documented the first rediscovery of the Spear of Athens in the ruins of an ancient temple
                    to Athena. The spear was found in the hands
                    of a minor statue to Athena, but exact circumstances of its rediscovery are debated. The temple's
                    purpoted location was not known to have been
                    a site of worship for Athena, and the spear was not mentioned in any historical records of the
                    temple. Furthermore, the only primary source
                    documenting the rediscovery was a memoir from a traveling cleric who regularly visited the temple.
                    The cleric's memoir was published posthumously
                    after their disappearance following an attempt to track down the would-be claimant. <br>
                    <br>
                    The memoir itself features the most detailed depiction of the spear to date, and the magical
                    properties described in the memoir match those
                    from historical records. Skeptical scholars argue that the cleric not taking the spear with them or
                    drawing any attention to the rediscovery
                    is evidence of the memoir's fabrication. An investigation into the temple itself revealed that the
                    spear had indeed been present at the temple
                    for some time, but the exact circumstances of its arrival and departure remain unknown. The spear
                    itself and the cleric were not found during
                    the investigation and further attempts to locate either were deemed too dangerous.

                <h3>Last Account</h3>
                <p>
                    The latest account of the Spear of Athens comes from merchants traveling through the city of
                    Phaethon. They reported that the mysterious
                    castle owner, known only as the Alchemist, had come into possession of a powerful spear matching the
                    description of the Spear of Athens. Little
                    is known about the Alchemist, but the merchants reported that on their visit to the castle, the
                    Alchemist possessed a variety of magical artifacts
                    one of which was the spear in question. The merchants were unable to provide any further details
                    about the spear or the Alchemist, but they did
                    report that the castle was heavily fortified and that the Alchemist was a recluse. Petitioners
                    seeking the rumors of the spear were either
                    turned away or never seen again. Scholars were unable to verify the merchants' account, but a party
                    of adventurers were recently seen leaving
                    the Alchemist's castle with a spear in tow. These adventurers passed through Phaethon and
                    eyewitnesses report that the spear was indeed the
                    Spear of Athens. With Athens having been destroyed by the Lich King, it is unknown what the
                    adventurers plan to do with the spear. Hopeful
                    former citizens of Athens believe that the spear can slay the Lich King and bring peace to the
                    Realms once more.

                    The Spear of Athens is a red lance with a flame-colored tip. The shaft is made of a silver alloy
                    that is both light and strong. Its lightweight
                    design allows the wielder to use the lance as a traditional spear without sacrificing speed or
                    power. The enchantments on the spear make it both
                    more precise and more lethal than a traditional spear. Historical accounts of the spear in battle
                    describe its wielders conjuring lances of fire
                    to strike down their enemies. These flaming lances pierce through armor and shield alike, channeling
                    Athena's wrath to smite her enemies.
