        <h2>The Artifacts</h2>

        <p>The Artifacts are a collection of magical items and objects that can be found in the world.
            These artifacts are imbued with powerful magic, and are often sought after by heroes and villains alike. The
            Artifacts are divided into several categories, each dedicated to a different type of item.</p>
