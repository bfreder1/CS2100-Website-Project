# CS2100-Website-Project

Overview:

* This repo houses a faux-wiki dedicated the fictional world of the Grecian Realms penned by Bryson Frederick.
* The website has 3 major sections:
    1. The Codex which acts as the heart of the wiki containing sections dedicated to various items of import in the world. 
    2. The Contribution section is meant to mimic a forum for discussion regarding the wiki.
    3. The maps section which is simply a collection of various maps from the campaign.
* The website can be visited by using the following link: https://bfreder1.github.io/CS2100-Website-Project/index.html 

Note for Reviewer: Several sections of the website are stubbed out and have not been completed yet. 

Submission notes 11/5/2024: I was unable to get the image gallery working how I wanted it, the example in 11.7 does not work on smaller screens and trying to adapt that style into a responsive format proved too difficult a task.
